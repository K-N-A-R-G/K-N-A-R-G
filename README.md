- 👋 Hi, I’m @K-N-A-R-G, just Knarg. Python-developer (NOT web-developer).
- 👀 I’m interested in multi-threaded and asynchronous programs for processing information,
-  as well as constructing logical circuits to control many external consumers in real-time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQLite, PostgreSQL, PgAdmin, SQLAlchemy, Rust.
- 💞️ I would be glad to participate in a project like
- 'housing complex management' or something similar.
