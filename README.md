# Hi, I'm Knarg — Python Developer / Data Engineer

I work on practical, reliable, and well-structured software: data processing pipelines, analytical tooling, automation utilities, and system-level components. My focus is on clarity, performance, and predictable architecture rather than UI polish.

## Areas of Expertise

- Python development with emphasis on modular architecture, typing, maintainability.
- Data processing pipelines: ETL/ELT, normalization, validation, transformation.
- SQL-based analytics with SQLite and PostgreSQL.
- Concurrency and parallel execution (threads, multiprocessing, asyncio).
- Backend logic: FastAPI applications, structured request/response flows.
- Developer tooling: CLI utilities, automation scripts, Git workflow helpers.
- System-level engineering on Linux (Mint XFCE).

## Current Technical Focus

- Building full ETL pipelines for analytical workloads.
- Template-driven data normalization for CSV/JSON sources.
- Analytical layers using Pandas + SQL.
- Backend components for data-heavy tasks.
- Docker-based reproducible environments.
- Rust for low-level logic and performance-sensitive tooling.

## Types of Projects I’m Interested In

- Data collection, cleaning, and analysis systems.  
- Industrial/process automation logic and structured control flows.  
- Local-first and offline-capable analytical tools.  
- Infrastructure-related platforms with clear execution paths and reliability requirements.  
- Any project where correctness, performance, and architecture matter more than visual effects.
