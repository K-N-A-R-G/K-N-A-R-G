## 👋 Hi, I’m @K-N-A-R-G — just Knarg

I'm a Python developer (not a web developer), passionate about building reliable, efficient, and well-structured programs — especially those that work with data, run in parallel, or interact with the real world.

### 👀 Areas of Interest

- Development of **multi-threaded** and **asynchronous** systems for intensive data processing.
- Design of **logical control flows** and **circuit-like decision systems** to manage multiple external devices or consumers in real-time.
- Creating **tooling** and **automation** for local workflows — from system utilities to data analyzers.

### 🌱 Currently Learning

- SQL-based technologies: **SQLite**, **PostgreSQL**, **PgAdmin4**.
- Programmatic DB interaction with **SQLAlchemy**.
- System-level programming in **Rust**.
- Docker-based isolation and environment management.
- Deepening knowledge of **data parsing**, **logging**, and **visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tkinter).

### 💡 Would Love to Join

I'm especially interested in contributing to projects like:

- **Housing or facility management systems**
- **Smart control of physical infrastructure**
- **Data collection + analysis pipelines for local/offline use**
- Anything where **performance**, **reliability**, and **clear architecture** matter more than UI glitz
